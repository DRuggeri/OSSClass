## Overview
* Open Source software is found everywhere
  * It is world changing technology
  * Backbone of Internet servers
  * Found in nearly every consumer device
* Open source software is software still
  * Failure reasons are similar to proprietary software
    * Vague requirements
    * Shifting scope
    * Ignoring user feedback
      * DO NOT do this!!!
  * Fails also for other reasons
    * Onboarding new devs
      * ... have lots of questions
      * ... doesn't provide immediate value
      * ... have to train devs on your culture
    * Presentation and packaging
      * Dev doco must be awesome
      * Your web page cannot suck
      * Easy to get, build and run
    * Marketing woes
      * Coders may not be good UI folks
      * Webmasters and presentation needs
    * Management issues
      * Same tactics don't always work in open source as they do internally
      * An already independent group (developers) needs cohesion with strong project management
        * Should be behind the scenes
    * Cultural
      * Geographic and simple cultural differences
      * Code of Conduct for proj is ESSENTIAL
* Emphasize again
  * It is a lot of work to open up
  * It is hard to open closed software
  * Benefits take time to show up
  * These costs are up front
* Benefits are plentiful
  * "Free labor"
  * Peer recognition
  * Resume booster
  * Exposure to outside ideas (this is huge)


## History
* Originally, hardware was the differentiator for tech businesses
  * Software was extended by users
  * Changes shared with mfg and other users
* Major differences from today:
  *Architecture was not generic
    * What you learn and do on platform A was not portable to platform B
    * Your skills were tied to the platform
    * Sharing software meant more lock-in
  * No Internet!
    * Hard to distribute data
  * Software wasn't a selling point
* Big industry shifts
  * A few architectures won out
  * "High level languages"
    * Write once, compile the same code for different architectures
    * If written for machine A, it could now work on machine B
  * HW performance levelled out (less of a differentiator)
    * Margins dropped
    * Required mfgs to find new sources of revenue
* Results:
  * SW became a value add for the platform
    * Sharing SW cuts the value
    * Competitors could also get the SW, too
    * Tgis must be stopped!
  * Access to code was restricted
    * Legal agreements (NDA) if code was available
    * Sometimes also required for binaries


## The rise of the movement
* Several separate people/groups had a similar idea
  * But with different motivations
* Richard Stallman
  * AI lab at MIT
    * Culture of SW sharing at MIT
      * Common to academia
      * Similar to sharing reaearch
    * Co-workers hired away by a proprietary SW company
    * New HW w/proprietary OS went to the lab
  * Resigned and started FSF
    * GPL license
      * Code can be copied and modified
      * Derivatives must be GPL
        * (Viral)
      * Must always be free
      * Uses legal protections opposite of traditional use
        * Instead of enforcing restrictions, it enforces freedoms
    * GNU project started
      * Free OS
      * Free utilities
      * Utilities were so good they started being used on non-free OSs
      * 1990 most of OS done, but kernel still far away
    * Linus Torvalds and collaborators...
      * Linux - the missing kernel
    * FSF Rhetoric
      * Tied politics to code
      * Made it a cause, not convenience
      * Idealism motivation
* GNU Not the only free OS project
    * BSD
      * UCB
      * Already underway in 1990
      * Reimplemented UNIX (versus being a new system altogether)
      * Non idealism motivation
    * X Windows
      * MIT - partnered with vendors
      * 1980s
      * Unique license
        * Free core
        * Proprietary stuff can be add on
        * Level playing field
          * Not idealogic
          * More for standards
          * Business motivation
    * TeX
      * Donald Knuth
      * Code can be modified, but can't be called Tex unless it passed a compatibility test
      * Trademark protection motivation

## Reasons to work with free code
* Ideology
* Technical excitement
* Collaboration with others
* The code is generally good
  * Comparable to proprietary
  * Sometimes better
  * Cheaper, at least
