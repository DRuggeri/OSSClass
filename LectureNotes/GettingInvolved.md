# Getting Involved

* Communities want to grow
  * Refer to [previous lecture](Communities.md) about community importance
  * Generally, as projects grow, they move away from BDFL/Lone Wolf models
    * More "stable" over time if more get involved
    * With more heads come more ideas
* There is a genereal path for getting involved
  * Not 100% of people take this route
  * Some folks take the route only up to a certain point
* See definitions below
* A path for getting involved
  * Obtain [more merit](CommunityModels.md)
    * Some do this over the course of many years
      * Casual participation
      * Busy with lots of projects
      * Come and go as time allows
    * Some do this very quickly
      * Work on the project during their day job
      * Can focus more resources, etc
  * **Important point**: All contributions matter and earn merit
  * User
    * As a user of the software, you have some of the best information
    * What bugs are out there?
      * Lots of bugs are caught during development
      * Some bugs ship so devs want to hear about it
    * How are you using the software?
      * What are unique things in your environment devs need to know about?
      * What integration points are important to you?
    * Does the software do what you think it should?
    * Is the documentation good?
    * Things a user does to earn merit
      * Tests the builds and provides feedback
      * Opens bug reports
      * Identifies gaps in the documentation
      * Hangs out in the various communications channels and helps answers questions
    * These all provide value to the community
      * This improves the standing of the user in the community
      * The community begins to value their contributions
      * Trust in the individual grows and they gain "weight"
  * Contributor
    * You've used the software but now want to scratch an itch
    * Contributors do what the name implies - they contribute something of technical value to the project
      * That is **not** to say the things an active user contributes isn't valuable
      * It's a gray area, but we'll draw the line at the exchange of bits
    * In addition to what a user may do, contributors...
      * Provide code changes as patches or pull requests
        * Add a new feature the contributor wants to see in the product
        * Fixes a bug they have found
        * Resolves bugs in the tracker by providing code
        * Adds to or fixes documentation
    * In short, a contributor does work on technical aspects of the project
      * The work they do is shared with the project
      * Someone with commit access will need to accept the contribution
    * Work is usually implicitly covered under a Contributor License Agreement
    * The contributor's input is highly valued by the community
      * Code changes are almost always welcomed
      * This shows the community the contributor is serious...
        * ... enough about the project to give their own time
        * ... enough about the project to invest in the project
      * The end sum is that the contributor gains merit and thanks for the work they do
  * Committer
    * You have provided so much value to the community that you have earned the commit bit
      * Formal recognition of contributions
      * Trusted to have write access to the repository
    * Being a committer on a project means that you are "officially" a developer on the project
      * Yeah, that can go on your resume
    * In addition to what a contributor may do, committers...
      * Accept patches and pull requests to merge them into the code base
      * Are given additional access and responsibilities
        * Can update the web page
        * Can sometimes speak on behalf of the project
        * May be able to create categories in the tracker or communications tools
      * Perform the tasks around releasing the project
      * May be able to digitally sign a release
    * These are the folks that are the "guts" of running the project
  * Voter
    * Quick note
      * Not all projects distinguish between committer and voter
      * Some consider a committer the top level
      * Some consider a committer to have enough merit to write to the code base, but not vote on certain things
      * Example:
        * In the ASF, a committer can add code, but cannot vote on a release
        * To vote on a release, you must be on the project management committee
    * You have homework to read about voting in OSS projects (too much to cover here)
    * These individuals have binding say in what the project does for the most critical of things
    * In addition to what a committer may do, a voter...
      * Release a version of the project (special because a release cannot be undone)
      * Setting the direction for the project
      * Making significant changes
    * A voter participates in the democratic process in the project when conflicts arise
  * Other roles
    * Not all projects are run the same (see committer vs voter above)
      * Sometimes there are additional levels or roles involved
      * There is no official way that must be done
    * Foundation participation creates its own set of levels and responsibilities
      * Legal or marketing
      * Conference or event planning
      * Board or membership
* Major takeaways
  * This is all about building **merit** and **credibility** in the community
    * As you do more, you are trusted more
    * Think of it as: By acting responsible, you are given more responsibilities
  * With a meritocracy, those who DO are given the most "weight"
  * Trust comes because one has shown their investment
