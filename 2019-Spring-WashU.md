# Computer Science and Engineering - Software Engineering Workshop
An introduction and exploration of concepts and issues related to large-scale software systems development. Areas of exploration include technical complexities, organization issues, and communication techniques for large-scale development. Students participate through teams emulating industrial development. The projects cover the principal system development life-cycle phases from requirements analysis, to software design, and to final implementation. Issues relating to real-time control systems, human factors, reliability, performance, operating costs, maintainability, and others are addressed and resolved in a reasonable manner. Prerequisite: Junior or Senior standing

## Course Overview
This course is intended to introduce students to the concepts of Open Source software development as well as deliver a software product for a real-world client. Specific areas of focus are:
* History of Open Source
* Communities and governance
* Technologies used
  * Source control
  * Communications tools
  * Issue trackers
* Legal aspects (licensing/foundations)

Additionally, students should expect to be challenged in areas of personal development related to the business environment such as giving presentations, writing position papers and performing the full lifecycle of software development in a team setting.

## Assignments and Grading
In full transparency, the assignments as well as how they are graded are shared in this section

### Team Project
This is the bulk of the grade you will earn as well as the primary focus of the class.
Each student will participate in a team responsible for delivering a software product to a client.
By the middle of the semester, an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) should be completed.
By the end of the semester, the final project with client feedback incorporated is expected.
* Students will share ideas of projects in the second week
  * The client may be any real-world use case. Non-for-profits, corporate projects, campus projects, etc are all encouraged
  * You may not be your own client
  * Your client and their satisfaction is greatly important
* Teams will be self-formed by the students and will consist of five to seven students
  * Each member of the team will receive the same grade for the project as a whole
  * Choose your teammates wisely - ensure coverage of important skills (code and non-code)


Grading for the project will be based on the effective execution of the following SDLC aspects:
* Gathering requirements and understanding the client's needs
* Incorporating client feedback into designs post-MVP
* Overall project planning and timing
* Time management and aligning deliverables in expected sprints
* User experience and non-code materials (documentation, UI, ease of use, etc)
* "Marketing" and presenting the final result
* Effective use of team skills and individual expertise
* Client evaluation of the delivered product

The system must be delivered in whole for grading.
Examples:
* Projects delivering a web-based resource would provide the public URL and credentials for evaluation
* Projects delivering mobile applications would provide a physical device for evaluation (sorry - instructor will not install things onto his gear)
* Projects delivering software that operates on a desktop environment would provide a virtual machine image (VirtualBox preferred) on a thumb drive

The final system will be presented to the class and your clients.
This presentation will take between 20 and 30 minutes.

### Homework
Homework assignments will be passed out from time to time involving reading, researching or taking some action. These assignments should be completed by the next class

### Presentation
Each student will be required to give a short presentation about a topic related to Open Source of their choosing (approved by instructor).
The presentation should be 5 to  10 minutes long.

The reason for this requirement is two-fold:
* To ensure a certain level of mastery of the topic such that it can be explained well
* To ensure a certain level of mastery *in giving a presentation*

This is so each student gets experience in exercising their "marketing" muscle which is not only required in the world of business, but also the world of Open Source.
While presentations will be graded on content, a significant portion of the grade will also come from organization of the content, aesthetics of any materials presented as well as the ability to adhere to guiding principles for good presentations.

Some ideas:
* Why I love the (name) Open Source project
* Five ways to make money on Open Source
* An analysis of Open Source license X versus license Y
* A guide to getting started in an Open Source project

### Writing
Communicating well is critically important in the world outside of the classroom and, similar to giving presentations, is a muscle that must be exercised regularly.
Students will be tasked with writing short papers in the form of:
** Summary documents ** which should be written in a form suitable for a manager to understand the landscape or overview of a concept they are not familiar with. In addition to the points earned in position papers, these documents will also be graded on accuracy of their factual contents and the simplification of complex topics.

#### Source Control for Pointy Hairs
Exactly 1 physical page  
I am a manager that has worked in manufacturing all of my career but have recently moved to become the manager of a software development team.
I hear people mention "source control" and things like "commit", "branch", "tag" and such but I don't know what any of these things are.
Provide me a one-pager that explains what source control is and gives a few key terms/definitions.

### Participation
The world of Open Source is driven by community so it is important that the community within our classroom is full of individuals willing to contribute to the success of the whole class.
Therefore, participation during discussions and presentations as well as within code and the project will be measured over the course of the semester and will contribute to a significant portion of the grade.

### Extra Credit
Through the course of the semester, students will have opportunities to earn extra credit.
Opportunities will be shared as they come along.
* Contribute fixes to this course's content
* Contribute fixes to a real Open Source project
* Attend [ACM events](https://acm.wustl.edu/)

## Schedule
This is the planned schedule of events for the course.
Since topics may run longer or come up short, expect some minor alterations.
